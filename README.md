### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a 3-day Introduction to ChIP-sequencing data analysis workshop. This workshop focuses on teaching basic computational skills to enable the effective use of an high-performance computing environment to implement a ChIP-seq data analysis workflow. It includes an introduction to shell (bash) and shell scripting. In addition to running the ChIP-seq workflow from FASTQ files to peak calls and nearest gene annotations, the workshop covers best practice guidlelines for ChIP-seq experimental design and data organization/management and quality control.

> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

### Learning Objectives

1.	Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.
2.	Understand best practices for designing a ChIP-seq experiment and analysis the resulting data.
